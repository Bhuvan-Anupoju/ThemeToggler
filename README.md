# 🌓 Theme Toggle 

- This project is a React application that demonstrates how to implement a global light/dark theme toggle using the Context API.
- The app includes a product card design (e.g., Nike shoes card) that adapts its background, text, and overall style dynamically based on the selected theme.
- It also features a theme toggle button that updates the theme across the entire app without prop drilling.
#### 🔰overview
- Managing theme preferences (light or dark mode) across multiple components in a React application can become difficult if we rely only on props. The Context API solves this problem by allowing us to share data globally without manually passing props through each level of the component tree.
